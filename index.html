            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="images/hilstad-maxx copy.jpg" width="200px">
            <p id="about">I am from San Diego, CA but I've lived many different places.
                My family were missionaries so we've lived in Burkina Faso and
                France. I speak french and love to speak it even though I've 
                forgotten quite a bit of it in the five years I've been back in 
                the US. 
            </p>
            <h2>Things I Like:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Playing guitar. I work at my church and getting to play on Sundays is my favorite.</li>
                <li>Coding. There's something so relaxing and enjoyable about it.</li>
                <li>Reading. My goal is to read 15 books in 2025. 1 down, 14 more to go!</li>
